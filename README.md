# Blood Vessel Segmentaion Using FCN, U-net and Segnet
#### implement a Python solution to segment blood vessels in retinal images, using a subset of the DRIVE database.

##### Task implementation:
##### For this task, you may employ a wide range of supervised and unsupervised segmentation techniques and their hybrids, along with appropriate pre- and post-processing techniques. Some of the relevant publications are provided as supplementary materials to this project only as a guidance.

##### Data Provided:
##### 1. 40 original retinal images in TIF format, divided into 20 training images and 20 test images
##### 2. Corresponding ground-truth segmentation masks for both training and test
##### 3. Background masks â€“ the background (black) around the retinal image is given as a mask and you may use this mask to separate the background (for both training and test subsets)

##### Evaluation:
##### You should utilise the training images and their labels for designing the algorithm and training of the supervised segmentation algorithms. You should then evaluate the segmentation results on the test images and the ground-truth provided. You should also investigate and use appropriate evaluation metric(s).
